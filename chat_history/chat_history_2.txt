        "content": "Title: Dawn of War , Content: Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is a real-time strategy computer game developed by Relic Entertainment based on Games Workshop's popular tabletop wargame, Warhammer 40,000. It was released for the PC by THQ on September 20, 2004 in North America. \nIt would spawn a series of sequels that would prove to be the best-selling Warhammer 40,000 video games of all time and would serve as the entry point into the Warhammer 40,000 universe for countless fans.\nSince the original game was made available, three expansion packs have been produced: Winter Assault in 2005, Dark Crusade in 2006 and Soulstorm in 2008. \nThe Game of the Year Edition was released on September 20, 2005 in the USA and on September 23, 2005 in Europe, containing 4 exclusive maps. Later, the Game of the Year edition and Winter Assault were bundled in the Gold Edition in the USA.\nMost recently, Dawn of War and the first two expansions were released together as The Platinum Collection in the USA or as the Dawn of War Anthology in the PAL regions. The sequel title, Dawn of War II, was released in February 2009., Url: /wiki/Dawn_of_War\nTitle: Dawn of War III , Content: Dawn of War III Box Art\"In darkness, I shall be light  In times of doubt, I shall keep faith In throes of rage, I shall hone my craft  In vengeance, I shall have no mercy In the midst of battle, I shall have no fear In the face of death, I shall have no remorse...\"\nDawn of War III is a real-time strategy video game released by Relic Entertainment and Sega in partnership with Games Workshop, the creators of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. It is the third stand-alone title in the Dawn of War series, and the first new release in the series since Dawn of War II - Retribution in 2011. It was released for Microsoft Windows on April 27, 2017.\n\"Fiery skies shall light the way,and blood shall spill over the wandering world.The Spear of Khaine shall call the wayfarers,and the Storm Prince shall unite them.Their victory shall shake the heavens.\"\nA \"catastrophic weapon,\" known only as the Spear of Khaine, has been discovered on the planet Acheron, long lost in the Warp, and three forces eventually converge on the world to recover it -- the Blood Ravens Space Marines under their legendary Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos, the Eldar led by Farseer Macha (with both heroes returning from the first game), and an Ork WAAAGH! led by Warboss Gorgutz (his fourth appearance, after Dawn of War - Winter Assault, Dawn of War - Dark Crusade, and Dawn of War - Soulstorm)., Url: /wiki/Dawn_of_War_III\nTitle: Dawn of War - Winter Assault , Content: Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Winter Assault is the first expansion to Dawn of War for the PC, developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ. Based on Games Workshop's tabletop wargame, Warhammer 40,000, Dawn of War - Winter Assault was released on September 23, 2005. \nSome time after its initial release, Winter Assault and Dawn of War were coupled together in a double pack which featured some art on a fold-out cover, an Ork with a Flamer, or a group of Imperial Guard tanks lined up for attack. It was the first of three expansion packs released by THQ in 2005.\nA new faction was included in Winter Assault, the Imperial Guard, previously only available in certain single-player missions of Dawn of War. The Imperial Guard specialises in defence, and therefore has the strongest defensive structures of all the factions in the game. Their infantry tends to be of lower quality than that of their opponents in terms of weapons, armour, and morale, but the Imperial Guard makes up for this with a range of powerful tanks, such as the Baneblade and Leman Russ, as well as the combat walkers called Sentinels, which until the Dark Crusade expansion were the only vehicular unit in the game which could uncapture strategic points., Url: /wiki/Dawn_of_War_-_Winter_Assault\nTitle: Armageddon , Content: In 1992, Games Workshop released Battle for Armageddon, a board game detailing the events of the Second Armageddon War. The events of that war also served as the background for the Warhammer 40,000 2nd Edition starter boxed set.\n\"Have I ever seen such scum as this before? Yes, the last time they came here. Has it been so long that you young'uns don't remember or are you simply too stupid to know who I am?\"\nFifty-seven standard years to the day after his first attempt to conquer Armageddon, Ghazghkull Thraka led a second Ork WAAAGH! against the planet in 998.M41, unleashing the Third War for Armageddon. Commissar Yarrick and many of the heroes who had fought in defence of the planet before were called to battle again. The conflict ultimately ended in a stalemate, with neither side able to take full control of the world, though the cost in lives and treasure was immense. Armageddon will need many solar decades, if not centuries, to recover from the war., Url: /wiki/Armageddon\nTitle: Armageddon , Content: Within only a few standard centuries, the world once known as Ullanor became a prime location for Human settlement due to its virgin status and strategic location in the Segmentum Solar. Once colonised, Ullanor eventually came to be known by a new name, one that would echo down the millennia and become a pivotal point of contention between the Greenskin races and Mankind -- Armageddon.\nThe First War for Armageddon is perhaps the least well-known of the conflicts fought on the world, and probably for good reason. Chaos Cultists worshipping the Chaos God Khorne initiated a rebellion against the world's Imperial government during a Warp storm they summoned. Soon, a great space hulk appeared over the planet, containing none other than Angron, the Daemon Prince of Khorne who had once been the primarch of the World Eaters Traitor Legion.\nThe daemonic legions and Chaos Cultists quickly pushed the Imperial defenders back in an orgy of bloodshed, until help arrived in the form of the Space Wolves and the Grey Knights Space Marines. With the Space Wolves bolstering the planetary defences, the Grey Knights fought through to the center of the daemonic horde, eventually banishing Angron and his army from the material world back to Warpspace, leaving the cultists to be crushed by the Imperial counterattack., Url: /wiki/Armageddon\nTitle: Chaos Daemons , Content: The incessant warring of this period sees the rise of Khorne in the Immaterium, and the Blood God is once more first amongst the Great Game's players.
