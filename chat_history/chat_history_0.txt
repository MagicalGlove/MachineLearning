Should a maniple of robots find itself in battle mode without a Datasmith, it will continue to prosecute its last doctrina protocol until it runs out of power -- something that usually takes solar weeks of unbridled slaughter to achieve. Such risks and limitations are willingly accepted by the Cult Mechanicus, for the act of hardwiring independent thought into a battle automaton is strictly forbidden., Url: /wiki/Cybernetica_Datasmith\nTitle: Ethereal , Content: Aun: \"Is that so hard to believe?

Long thought to be a myth, many Imperial savants now believe that such a realm does indeed exist, and that it could hold a valuable STC system on its surface.\nIt has long been posited that there existed a domain of the fallen Mechanicus beyond the boundaries of the Imperium and that it was a Forge World predating the Age of Strife which was never contacted during the Great Crusade. Various legends have surfaced of a world of crippled hell-smiths that prostrate themselves before a cyclopean machine altar, sending up venerations in sonorous binaric cant that echoes weirdly through the Empyrean and can be perceived by Imperial Warp-seers when the tides of the Sea of Souls is especially strong.\nIt has recently been learned by Inquisitorial agents that a Phaenonite cell and their unhallowed master believes Crucible-Omega is very real indeed and that the altar its population worships is in fact a functional Standard Template Construct system. The Inquisition has mobilised available assets to ascertain the current status of this group of adversaries and have recommended a convocation of an Inquisitorial Conclave at the earliest opportunity to debate the matter further. Crucible-Omega's current status is unknown., Url: /wiki/Crucible-Omega\n"
